      Embracing Upcycling and Repurposing
    </h2>

    <p>
      Upcycling and repurposing existing materials and furnishings are key tenets of sustainable design. Transform old furniture, fixtures, or architectural elements into new and functional pieces. Embrace creativity by breathing new life into discarded items, reducing waste, and minimizing the need for new resource extraction.
